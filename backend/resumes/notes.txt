First, we need info about all of the users. See `sql.txt` for two scripts, that produce two files (users_all.csv, users_teams.csv). Run the scripts and save the csvs, according to the instructions in sql.txt.

Next, run the `download.py` script. **Make sure to update GCLOUD_BUCKET_RESUMES!**
For posterity, here's an outline of what it does:
pull all resumes (for all verified ones), preserve user ids
for each group of users (hs us, hs intl, college us, college intl, others that aren't devs): 
	in ascending scrim rank, find associated resume
	rename to "#elo FirstLastResume"
Also for users in users_all not in users_teams find resume as "FirstLastResume"

Then, the resumes are in the `files` folder! Make sure to go through all of them, to remove any pdfs that seem corrupt, throwaway resumes (eg blank files), etc. 

Then publish them (we usually just upload all of them to a gdrive folder) and share them with sponsors!
