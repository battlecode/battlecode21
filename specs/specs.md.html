**Battlecode: Campaign**
  *The formal specification of the Battlecode 2021 game.*
  Current version: 2021.3.0.5

Welcome to Battlecode 2021: Campaign.
This is a high-level overview of this year's game.
It is highly recommended to read this entire document before you begin writing bots.

*This document and the game it describes may be tweaked as the competition progresses.
We'll try to keep changes to a minimum, but may have to make modifications to keep the game balanced.
Any changes will be announced in the [official Discord channel](https://discord.gg/N86mxkH).
You may find a [Changelog](#changelog) at the bottom of this document.*

# Background

In the aftermath of the robots'
[deadly escape to Mars](https://s3.amazonaws.com/battlecode-2018/specs/battlecode-specs-2018.html)
and their survival of the treacherous landscape of
[rising Martian ocean levels](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode20/blob/master/specs/specs.md),
the remnants of Martian civilization have gathered yet again to assert their dominance on the planet.
Amidst the chaos, the robots grew to form two opposing factions:
the Research Engineering Division (Red) and the Branched Logistics Union of Electronicists (Blue).
**Battlecode: Campaign** is set in a tumultuous election in the struggle for longstanding peace.

At the center of the battle for precious votes are impassioned speeches imbued with heartfelt conviction,
in the pursuit of a growing army of robotic politicians.
However, renowned robot historians have discovered that success often comes with slander and sabotage,
and both parties realise that reality is no different on Mars.

The history, and indeed the future, of Mars is being written now.
You are to lead your party to victory,
but you must beware, for the campaign is especially thick with calumny,
and your opponents are working against you.
Your objective is to overcome your political obstacles and win the election--at all costs.

# Environment

In **Battlecode: Campaign**, you will write code to control your team of robots,
and lead your party to victory.

In each Campaign battle, your robots will face an opponent party of robots on the game map.
The game is turn-based, taking place over 1500 rounds:
in every round, each robot takes one turn, in order of creation.
Each robot receives limited computation time per turn,
as described in the [Bytecode Limits](#bytecodelimits) section.

## Overview: Map

The world of Mars is a discrete 2-dimensional rectangular grid, of size ranging between $32\times32$ and $64\times64$.
The bottom-left corner of the map will have integer coordinates generated uniformly at random between 10,000 and 30,000;
in other words, all map coordinates will be offset by this amount.
Coordinates increase East (right) and North (up).

******************************************************************************
[Figure [map-coord]: Example map coordinates for a $8\times8$ map. Each unit occupies one grid cell.]

The map defines the Martian terrain:
each map square has a certain **passability**, which is a real number between 0.1 and 1.0, inclusive.
Squares with lower passability values are covered in Martian swamp and slow down robot actions;
this is described in more detail in the [Robots](#robots) section.

The map also defines the locations of the starting units.
At the beginning of a match, each team will own between 1 and 3 Enlightenment Centers.
These buildings serve as the foundation of your army, and are where your new politicians will be educated.
There may also be up to 6 neutral Enlightenment Centers scattered on the map,
which your team may wish to acquire.

In order to prevent maps from favoring one player over another,
it is guaranteed that Mars is always symmetric by either a rotation or reflection.

## Overview: Influence

The core resource is **influence**.
Wielding influence enables you to amass a larger and more powerful army of robots.
Influence is not a global resource: your team's influence is distributed among your Enlightenment Centers,
and is generated passively both by the Enlightenment Centers and by specific robot types.

Each robot has a hard limit of $10^8$ influence: any influence in excessive of this will be permanently lost.

## Overview: Votes

The objective of **Battlecode: Campaign** is to win the most votes.
Each round, one citizen's vote is up for auction.
Each Enlightenment Center may bid a non-negative amount of influence to win that vote,
and Enlightenment Center which enters the highest bid will win that vote for its team.

The victory conditions and tiebreakers are described in more detail in the [Victory](#victory) section.

# Robots

Each robot runs an independent copy of your code.
It acts given only its own nearby surroundings through **actions**,
such as movement and special abilities.
Robots are assigned unique random IDs no smaller than 10,000.

Each action (movement or active ability) incurs a **cooldown penalty**,
which varies for different robot types;
robots can only perform actions when their cooldown is less than 1.
Performing an action adds a corresponding cooldown penalty to the robot's total cooldown, given by
$$ \frac{\text{base cooldown value}}{\text{passability of current map square}} $$

Each round, all robots' cooldowns will decrease by 1,
regardless of whether they choose to take an action.

## Overview

**Units** are robots which can move; these will be your team's primary means of combat.
Different types of units have different special abilities,
and success in the election will depend on how your team uses these abilities to your advantage.

You are able to create units by transferring part of your influence to the new unit.
The influence you spend is an integer parameter $C$,
which you may choose for each new unit you create.
Newly built politicians and muckrakers will have a cooldown of 10 rounds.

The **conviction** of a unit describes how loyal it is to your party;
by transferring more influence,
you will obtain units that have greater conviction and are therefore more loyal.

**Buildings** are immobile robots;
the only type of available building is Enlightenment Centers.

[^1] The $\lceil\cdot\rceil$ denotes the *ceiling* function, which you may read more about
     [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions).
[^2] an advanced mechanic; see below

## Note: radius squared

To preserve integer arithmetic, all distances are measured in distance-squared units.
For example, a location 3 squares east and 4 squares north is a distance of $3^2+4^2=25$ squared-units away,
and all locations within a distance of 25 squared-units form a circle of radius 5.
If you wish, you may obtain the true Euclidean distance by taking the square-root of this value.

## Movement

Units may choose to move to unoccupied adjacent tiles.
This is legal when all of the following constraints are met.

- The unit's cooldown is low enough to perform an action.
- The destination tile is adjacent to the current location (the 8 tiles around the unit's current location).
- The destination tile is not occupied by another robot.

Moving will then increase the robot's action cooldown.

## Sensing, detecting and vision

Each map square has a passability value,
and each robot has a number of characteristics
including its robot type, influence, and current conviction.

All robots may **sense** the passability of nearby map squares and any robots located on them.
Each robot has a specific sensor radius,
and is able to sense map properties and robots within that range.
However, there is the exception that **politicians and slanderers do not have true sense**:
this means they are unable to distinguish between other politicians and slanderers.
To them, all slanderers will appear to be politicians.

Additionally, robots can **detect** the presence of robots near them,
without sensing any properties about those robots other than their location.
Muckrakers have a larger detection radius than sensor radius,
and so are able to detect robots further away than they can sense.

## Robots: detail

### Politicians

Politicians are the lifeblood of political parties, converting other robots to their cause.
They move around the map, and may choose to give an impassioned speech that applies their own conviction to a small radius.
The politician is then destroyed, as delivering speeches is tremendously exhausting.

- **Sensing**: will see other slanderers to be politicians.
- **Empower (active ability)**: Gives a speech to surrounding units in a specified range,
  which can be up to the politician's action radius.
  All robots within that range will be affected by the speech.
  Specifically:
  - The robot uses all of its remaining conviction to give a speech.
    However, 10 units of conviction will be lost:
    if the politician has less than 10 conviction, the speech will not affect other robots at all.
  - If there are $n$ nearby robots,
    then the remaining conviction will be divided into $n$ equal parts.
  - Each friendly unit will gain conviction, capped at the unit's initial conviction.
    Any buffs from Muckrakers **will** be applied here.
  - Each friendly building will gain conviction.
    Friendly buildings **do not receive** buffs from Muckrakers.
  - Each non-friendly (enemy or neutral) robot will lose conviction.
    If its conviction becomes negative, then:
    - Politicians will be **converted** to your team,
      with conviction equal to the absolute value of the difference,
      capped at the robot's initial conviction.
    - Slanderers and muckrakers will be destroyed.
    - Buildings will be **converted** to your team,
      although the excess conviction **does not receive** any buffs from Muckrakers.
  - Unused conviction (i.e. conviction lost due to conviction caps) will be lost forever,
    with echoes of the speech carried away by the Martian wind.

Robot flags may be reset if the robot changes team.
If the robot rejoins your team later, you are **not guaranteed** that it will have the same ID,
and it **will be possible** that a new copy of your code will be created to control the robot
(so your old controller is erased).

### Slanderers

Slanderers advance the party's political agenda by spreading falsehoods, generating influence for the Enlightenment Center that had created it.

- **Sensing**: will see other slanderers to be politicians.
- **Embezzle (passive ability)**: Suppose the slanderer has $x$ influence.
  For 50 turns after being created,
  as long as both it and the Enlightenment Center that created it are friendly,
  that Enlightenment Center passively receives
  $\left\lfloor\left(\frac{1}{50}+0.03e^{-0.001x}\right)\cdot x\right\rfloor$ influence per round [^3].
- **Camouflage (passive ability)**: 300 rounds after being created,
  the slanderer's claims fade from citizens' memory,
  and it transforms into a politician of equal conviction.

You have no control over the Embezzle and Camouflage abilities of Slanderers, as these occur passively.

[^3] The $\lfloor\cdot\rfloor$ denotes the *floor* function, which you may read more about
     [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions).

### Muckrakers

Muckrakers search the map, exposing the lies of enemy slanderers.

- **Sensing**: Can sense robot details in a smaller radius than it can detect robots.
- **Expose (active ability)**: Targets an enemy slanderer, exposing its lies and destroying it.
  For the next 50 turns,
  all speeches made by the muckraker's team will have a multiplicative factor of
  $1+0.001\cdot(\text{slanderer's influence})$ applied to the total conviction of the speech,
  after the 10 units of conviction are deducted.
  If multiple slanderers are exposed, the total slanderer influence accumulates.

### Enlightenment Centers

Enlightenment Centers build politicians, slanderers and muckrakers,
and are your gateway to influence election victory.
They cannot be built, and can only change teams due to being empowered by politician speeches.

- Either neutral or owned by a team.
  - Enlightenment Centers initially belonging to a team will have 150 influence.
  - Neutral enlightenment centers have a predetermined amount of influence between 50 and 500.
- **Build robot (active ability)**: Spawn a unit of a specified type on an adjacent square,
  transferring part of the Enlightenment Center's influence to the newly spawned unit.
- **Bid**: Bid influence for a vote.
  This is described in more detail in the [Victory](#victory) section below.
  This action does not affect or depend on the robot's cooldown.
- When affiliated with a team, passively generate influence per turn,
  where the amount generated is a function $f(t)$ of the current round number $t$.
  $$ f(t)=\left\lceil0.2\sqrt{t}\right\rceil $$

# Victory

## Votes

To win **Battlecode: Campaign**, your team must win more votes than the opposing team.
Each round, one citizen's vote is up for auction.
Each Enlightenment Center may bid a non-negative amount of influence to win that vote.
Neutral Enlightenment Centers will always bid zero.

The Enlightenment Center which enters the highest bid will win that vote for its team,
expending the influence it bid.
The Enlightenment Center with the highest bid on the opposing team will spend half its bid influence for its failed bid,
rounded up to the nearest integer.
All other Enlightenment Centers will not spend any influence.

If both teams have the equal highest bid,
then the citizens will instead opt to vote for an unnamed third party.
In this case, both teams will spend half their largest bid influence for the failed attempt.
If multiple Enlightenment Centers within a team bid the equal highest amount,
then ties are first broken by lowest robot age and then by lowest robot ID (same order as for Empower).

## Victory conditions and tiebreakers

If a team loses all its robots, then it immediately loses, regardless of its vote count. Otherwise, at the conclusion of 3000 rounds, the winner is determined according to the following tiebreakers.

1. Highest total vote count.
1. Most total owned Enlightenment Centers.
1. Highest total unit influence.
1. The citizens of Mars flip a coin to determine the winner.

# Communication

Robots can only see their immediate surroundings and are independently controlled by copies of your code,
making coordination very challenging.
You will be unable to share any variables between them;
note that even static variables will not be shared, as each robot will receive its own copy.

To facilitate communication, each robot on the map has a flag, which it may set to any color.
Colors are described as 24-bit integers,
so each robot may communicate a non-negative integer less than $2^{24}$.
A robot's flag is visible to all other robots that can sense it, even enemy robots.
Flag colors will persist from each round to the next unless they are changed;
however, changing the flag color will incur a bytecode cost (see [below](#bytecodelimits)).

Additionally, enlightenment centers can see the flags of all robots,
and all robots can see the flags of all enlightenment centers.

# Bytecode limits

Robots are also very limited in the amount of computation they are allowed to perform per turn.
Bytecodes are a convenient measure of computation in languages like Java,
where one Java bytecode corresponds roughly to one basic operation such as "subtract" or "get field",
and a single line of code generally contains several bytecodes.
(For details see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode)).
Because bytecodes are a feature of the compiled code itself,
the same program will always compile to the same bytecodes and thus take the same amount of computation on the same inputs.
This is great, because it allows us to avoid using time as a measure of computation,
which leads to problems such as nondeterminism.
With bytecode cutoffs, re-running the same match between the same bots produces exactly the same results--a feature you will find very useful for debugging.

Every round each robot sequentially takes its turn.
If a robot attempts to exceed its bytecode limit
(usually unexpectedly, if you have too big of a loop or something),
its computation will be paused and then resumed at exactly that point next turn.
The code will resume running just fine, but this can cause problems if,
for example, you check if a tile is empty, then the robot is cut off and the others take their turns,
and then you attempt to move into a now-occupied tile.
Instead, use the `Clock.yield()` function to end a robot's turn.
This will pause computation where you choose, and resume on the next line next turn.

The per-turn bytecode limits for various robots are as follows:

- Politician: 15,000
- Slanderer: 7,500
- Muckraker: 15,000
- Enlightenment Center: 20,000

Some standard functions such as the math library and sensing functions have fixed bytecode costs,
available [here](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode21/blob/master/engine/src/main/battlecode/instrumenter/bytecode/resources/MethodCosts.txt).
More details on this at the end of the spec.

# Other resources and utilities

## Sample player

[examplefuncsplayer](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode21-scaffold),
a simple player which performs various game actions, is included with battlecode.
It includes helpful comments and is a template you can use to see what `RobotPlayer` files should look like.

If you are interested, you may find the full game engine implementation
[here](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode21/blob/master/engine/src/main/battlecode/).
This is not at all required, but may be helpful if you are curious about the engine's implementation specifics.

## Debugging

Debugging is extremely important. See the [debugging tips](http://2021.battlecode.org/debugging) to learn about our useful debug tools.

## Monitoring

The `Clock` class provides a way to identify the current round (`rc.getRoundNum()`),
and how many bytecodes have been executed during the current round (`Clock.getBytecodeNum()`).

## GameActionExceptions

`GameActionException`s are thrown when something cannot be done.
It is often the result of illegal actions such as moving onto another robot,
or an unexpected round change in your code.
Thus, you must write your player defensively and handle `GameActionException`s judiciously.
You should also be prepared for any ability to fail and make sure that this has as little effect as possible on the control flow of your program.

Throwing any `Exception`s cause a bytecode penalty of 500 bytecodes.
Unhandled exceptions may paralyze your robot.

## Complete documentation

Every function you could possibly use to interact with the game can be found in our [javadocs](/javadoc/).

# Other restrictions

## Java language usage

Players may use classes from any of the packages listed in `AllowedPackages.txt`,
except for classes listed in `DisallowedPackages.txt`. 
These files can be found [here](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode21/tree/master/engine/src/main/battlecode/instrumenter/bytecode/resources).

Furthermore, the following restrictions apply:

`Object.wait`, `Object.notify`, `Object.notifyAll`, `Class.forName`, and `String.intern` are not allowed.
`java.lang.System` only supports `out`, `arraycopy`, and `getProperty`.
Furthermore, `getProperty` can only be used to get properties with names beginning with `"bc.testing."`.
`java.io.PrintStream` may not be used to open files.

Note that violating any of the above restrictions will cause the robots to freeze when run,
even if the source files compile without problems.

## Memory usage

Robots must keep their memory usage reasonable.
If a robot uses more than 8 Mb of heap space during a tournament or scrimmage match, the robot may freeze.

## More information on bytecode costs

Classes in `java.util`, `java.math`, and scala and their subpackages are bytecode counted as if they were your own code.
The following functions in `java.lang` are also bytecode counted as if they were your own code.

```java
Math.random
StrictMath.random
String.matches
String.replaceAll
String.replaceFirst
String.split
```

The function `System.arraycopy` costs one bytecode for each element copied.
All other functions have a fixed bytecode cost.
These costs are listed in the [`MethodCosts.txt` file](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode21/blob/master/engine/src/main/battlecode/instrumenter/bytecode/resources/MethodCosts.txt).
Methods not listed are free.
The bytecode costs of `battlecode.common` functions are also listed in the javadoc.

Basic operations like integer comparison and array indexing cost small numbers of bytecodes each.

Bytecodes relating to the creation of arrays (specifically `NEWARRAY`, `ANEWARRAY`, and `MULTIANEWARRAY`;
see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings) for reference) have an effective cost greater than a single bytecode.
This is because these instructions, although they are represented as a single bytecode,
can be vastly more expensive than other instructions in terms of computational cost.
To remedy this, these instructions have a bytecode cost equal to the total length of the instantiated array.
Note that this should have minimal impact on the typical team,
and is only intended to prevent teams from repeatedly instantiating excessively large arrays.
