# Requires achallonge, and _not_ pychal. Make sure to `pip uninstall pychal`, `pip install achallonge` etc before using.

# IMPORTANT -- BEFORE RUNNING THIS:
# Get the Challonge API Key. Set it to an env, CHALLONGE_API_KEY. DON'T PUSH NOR SCREENSHARE/STREAM IT!
# Get the tournament url, it's the alphanumeric string at the end of the tournament website's url. (e.g. http://challonge.com/thispart). Set it to the tour_url variable.
# Now with all those set, run the script as specified directly below:

# Usage:
# python challonge_pubber.py path/to/json.json start end
# path/to/json: a json produced by running the tour. Get this from someone who ran the tournament.
# start: the challonge match number (as shown on the bracket page) of the first Challonge match (or, if argv[3] not specified, the only challonge match) whose result is to be published
# end: optional; the challonge match number of the last Challonge match to be published, _exclusive_.
# e.g. python challonge_pubber.py path/to/replay_dump.json 1 4
# will publish the results of the Challonge bracket's matches 1, 2, and 3.
